# Script:       daily_bashrc.sh
#
# Description:  This script is sourced during user login via the bash
#               configuration to update and display the daily message.
#
#               Its functionality includes:
#                 - Checking if the daily message file (~/.dailyword) exists
#                   or is outdated (based on the current date) and regenerating
#                   it by executing the main dailyword script.
#                 - Appending a "# displayed <date>" marker to the file to
#                   indicate when the message was last displayed that helps..
#		  - .. avoiding the message display being consumed during boot process
#		    by displaying it only when the user is about to see the prompt
#		    in an interactive shell.
#                 - Providing a command alias ("oogf") and a function to recall
#                   the daily message.
#
# Usage:        The script is intended to be sourced from the userâ€™s .bashrc
#               file during shell startup. The alias "oogf" is made available
#               for manual message refresh.
#
# Caution:      Ensure that /opt/dailyword/dailyword.sh exists and is executable.
